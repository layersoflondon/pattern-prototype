# Layers of London Pattern Prototype
This is a repository of code for testing user interaction ideas and design. It's a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) application, but there isn't really any backend logic.

# To get running

* Clone this repo
* `bundle`
* `rails s` to run locally on port 3000


# To develop new templates and UI patterns

* Create a new template in app/views/layouts/templates - e.g. 'mypage.html.erb'
* Create any partials you need and `render` them in there
* Your page will be available at http://localhost:3000/mypage
